## 📌 Project Overview

Medication non-adherence is one of the leading causes of poor treatment outcomes and increased healthcare costs. This project analyzes patient medication adherence patterns using SQL and Power BI while leveraging a Random Forest Machine Learning model to predict patients who are at risk of discontinuing their medication.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, starting from database design and SQL analysis to predictive modeling in Python and interactive dashboard development in Power BI.

#  Business Objectives

- Analyze medication adherence trends.
- Identify patients at risk of treatment drop-off.
- Understand the impact of insurance type, age, region, and prescribing channel.
- Build a machine learning model for patient drop-off prediction.
- Create interactive dashboards for business and AI insights.
